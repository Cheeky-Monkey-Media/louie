# Louie â€” King of the Jungle

Louie uses Foundation 6.4+ and modern ES6+ coding practices for theme development.

## Installation

Install into your custom themes directory.

Run `npm install` from inside the Torsion directory.

From inside the Torsion directory, run `npm run build`. (`dev` command to come later.)

Once you have finished theming the first page (home/standard) - take a screenshot and replace screenshot.png with a true representation of the theme.

## Things to consider

As this is a starter theme, you should remove the .git folder after cloning. Then, commit with the rest of your project. An easy way to do this is by running `npm run degit`.

## Todos

- Test everything. Break somethings. Fix important things.
- Fix `dev` scripts. Currently relies on BrowserSync. Need to run some tests to see how this breaks in development.
- Add `clear cache` task for after build/dev runs.
- Add Mannequin frontmatter to twig templates.
- Add sprite generator
